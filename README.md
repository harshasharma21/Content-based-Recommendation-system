# Content Recommendation System

This project is a content recommendation system that suggests movies based on users' previously watched data. The system leverages collaborative filtering and natural language processing techniques to provide personalized recommendations.

## Overview

The recommendation system is built using the TMDB (The Movie Database) datasets, which include movie metadata and credits. The system processes this data to understand user preferences and suggest similar content.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering:** Utilizes user input to recommend movies that similar users have given.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Uses TF-IDF vectorization to analyze movie descriptions and other textual data.
- **Matrix Factorization:** Applies techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and cosine similarity to improve recommendation accuracy.

## Datasets

- **Movies Metadata:** Information about movies including title, genre, release date, etc.
- **Credits:** Information about cast and crew involved in the movies.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core programming language used for developing the recommendation system.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms and vectorization.
